Titanic Classification Task:
The Titanic classification task involves predicting whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on various features like socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. It's a classic binary classification problem often used for teaching and learning about machine learning algorithms and data analysis.


Number Recognition Task:
Number recognition, typically implemented using neural networks, is a task where handwritten or printed digits are recognized and classified into the corresponding numerical values (0 to 9). It finds applications in various fields, including optical character recognition, digitizing documents, and designing automated systems for reading and interpreting numerical information.
